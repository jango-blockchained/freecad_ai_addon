# Workbench Icon Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The error "Failed to get handle to AIWorkbench -- no icon can be generated, check classname in package.xml" was occurring when FreeCAD tried to load the AI addon workbench.

## Root Cause
1. The `AIWorkbench` class was located in a nested module (`freecad_ai_addon.integration.workbench`) which made it difficult for FreeCAD to find
2. The icon loading mechanism was using an inline SVG fallback that could cause issues
3. Complex import dependencies could fail during FreeCAD startup

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved Workbench to InitGui.py
- Moved the `AIWorkbench` class definition directly into `InitGui.py`
- This follows FreeCAD addon conventions and ensures the class is immediately accessible
- Removed the separate `workbench.py` file at the root level

### 2. Simplified Icon Handling
- Changed icon fallback from inline SVG to empty string
- Added proper exception handling for icon loading
- Made icon loading more robust with specific exception types

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Used specific exception types instead of broad `Exception` catches
- Added proper error messages and warnings
- Made the workbench more resilient to import failures

## Files Modified

1. **InitGui.py**: Complete rewrite with embedded AIWorkbench class
2. **workbench.py**: Deleted (no longer needed)
3. **freecad_ai_addon/integration/workbench.py**: Icon handling improvements

## Verification
Created `test_workbench_import.py` which confirms:
- ✅ AIWorkbench can be imported from InitGui
- ✅ Class can be instantiated
- ✅ Only fails on missing FreeCAD module (expected in non-FreeCAD environment)

## Result
The workbench should now load correctly in FreeCAD without the icon generation error. The classname in package.xml (`AIWorkbench`) now correctly references the class that FreeCAD can find and instantiate.
